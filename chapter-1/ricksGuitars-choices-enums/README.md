# rickGuitar-choices

### The Goal

the customer needs to have choices for all guitars that matches his criteria

### The Problem

1. the search() return only one guitar
2. string case sensitive

### The Soultion

1. create a List of guitars and push to it every guitar that matches the criteria
2. Replace all strings with *Enums* except for the model attribute since it does not has a limited set of these like there is with builders and wood.
