# rickGuitar-3-choices

Rick has found that he has two guitars that the customer may love so he was thinking if the search method could return both ?

### the goal

Rick decided to modify the search() method to return all matched guitars.

### the solution

Rick created a list of all matched guitars and push to it every guitar that matches the search criteria to provide the customer with options to choose which guitar fits his needs and return this list from the search method.
