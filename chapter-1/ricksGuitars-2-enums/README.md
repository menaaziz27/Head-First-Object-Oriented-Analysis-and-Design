# rickGuitar-2-enums

Rick has figured out that the customer has entered "fender" and the builder in the inventory called "Fender" which means that's a string case sensitive problem!

### The Goal

 Replace strings with constants to avoid mismatches.

### the solution

Rick has built Enums for each guitar (type - wood - builder) and replace those Enums with the existing strings except for the model since there really isn't a limited set of these like there is with builders and wood.
